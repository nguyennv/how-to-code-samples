# Sound Detector in JavaScript*

## Introduction

This smart sound detector application is part of a series of how-to Intel® Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison board, Intel® IoT Gateway, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:<br>

- Connect the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, computing platforms designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.<br>
- Interface with the Intel® Edison board or Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) board IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.<br>
- Run this code sample in Intel® XDK IoT Edition, an IDE for creating applications that interact with sensors and actuators, enabling a quick start for developing software for the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway.<br>
- Store this sound data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft Azure\*, Redis Store\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or ElastiCache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Set up a MQTT-based server using IoT Hub from Microsoft Azure\*, IoT from IBM Bluemix\*, or IoT from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, different cloud machine to machine messaging services based on the industry standard MQTT protocol.

## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, this project lets you create a smart loudness detector system that:<br>
- monitors a microphone sensor to detect the loudness in the area.<br>
- keeps track of the sound levels, using cloud-based data storage.

## How it works

This sound detector monitor uses the sensor to constantly keep track of the decibel level in a room. Every 100 ms the sensor finds the average sound samples and prints them to the LCD screen.

Optionally, it can log the sound level using the Intel® IoT Examples Datastore or an MQTT server running in your own Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* account.

To install Git\* on the Intel® Edison board (if you don’t have it yet), establish an SSH connection to the board and run the following command:

    $ opkg install git

### Connecting the Grove\* sensors

![](./../../images/java/sound-detector.jpg)

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino-compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove devices into the Grove Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove Shield set to **5V**.

1. Plug one end of a Grove\* cable into the Grove\* Sound Sensor, and connect the other end to the A0 port on the Grove\* Shield.

2. Plug one end of a Grove\* cable into the Grove\* RGB LCD, and connect the other end to any of the I2C ports on the Grove\* Shield.

### Connecting the DFRobot\* sensors

You need to have a LCD Keypad Shield connected to an Arduino-compatible breakout board to plug all the DFRobot\* devices into the LCD Keypad Shield.

1. Plug one end of a DFRobot\* cable into the Analog Sound Sensor, and connect the other end to the A2 port on the LCD Display Shield.

### Installing the program manually on the Intel® Edison board

If you're running this code on your Intel® Edison board manually, you need to install some dependencies.

To obtain the Node.js\* modules needed for this example to execute on the Intel® Edison board, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

### Intel® IoT Gateway setup

You can run this example using an Intel® IoT Gateway connected to an Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.).

Make sure your Intel® IoT Gateway is setup using Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, by following the directions on the web site here:

https://software.intel.com/en-us/getting-started-with-intel-iot-gateways-and-iotdk

You must install the Intel® XDK on the Intel® IoT Gateway, by following the directions on the above link, under the section "Connecting to the Intel® XDK".

The Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) board needs to have the Firmata\* firmware installed. If you have IMRAA installed on your gateway, this will be done automatically. Otherwise, install the StandardFirmata or ConfigurableFirmata sketch manully on to your Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) board.

You will also need to configure the `config.json` in the example to use the Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) board. See the section "Configuring the example" below.

### Data store server setup

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a backend database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\*, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

### MQTT server setup

You can also optionally store the data generated by this sample program using MQTT, a machine-to-machine messaging server. You can use MQTT to connect to Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud MQTT messaging server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt)

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "dfrobot"
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) board, add a `platform` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "platform": "firmata"
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file below the "THRESHOLD" value as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/access-control",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* MQTT messaging server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt/](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt/)

![](./../../images/js/air-quality-output.png)

You will see output similar to the above when the program is running.

### Determining the Intel® Edison IP address

You can determine what IP address the Intel® Edison board is connected to by running the following command:

    ip addr show | grep wlan

You will see output similar to the following:

    3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000
        inet 192.168.1.13/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global wlan0

The IP address is shown next to `inet`. In the example above, the IP address is `192.168.1.13`.
